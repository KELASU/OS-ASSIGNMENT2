This repository contains the os assignment implementation of
- FCFS

- C-SCAN

There is 4 python files:
- task1.py = this is where I did Task1 (There is a input(so you run the program and it will ask for input for the txt file and the initial position))
- task2.py = this is where I did Task2
- task2optic.py = is just some additional stuff for task 2 but with additional stuff added to scan for better results.
- textgen.py = this is the program or code I used to generate the txt file I used to test out the task
